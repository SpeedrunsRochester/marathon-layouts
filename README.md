# Speedruns Rochester Marathon Layouts

This is a NodeCG graphics bundle, and NodeCG must be installed to use it. It also uses [a fork of PowerUpWithPride's extra utilities](https://github.com/SpeedrunsRochester/nodecg-srroc).  
The following bundles are necessary to get everything working: 
```
speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol
SpeedrunsRochester/nodecg-srroc
SpeedrunsRochester/marathon-layouts
```

Once the NodeCG server has started, import the schedule in the Run Modifications tab.  
Layouts are changed in the Scene Editing tab, under "Game Layout Override" (functionality to automatically change this WIP)

Known Bugs:
* Resetting a racer's timer after completion removes the timer completely and requires a refresh to get it back. This is laggy and not recommended. Don't reset racer's timers if you can help it.


The code for these layouts was made with lots of inspiration from [PowerUpWithPride](https://github.com/PowerUpWithPride).
